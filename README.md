# Source Code of the CSR-x Website ★
This codebase establishes the source code for the CSR-x website, hosted on Cloudflare. CSR-x stands for Collaborative Summer Research eXperience. CSR-x is a free-of-charge, online summer research program serving high school students across the world since 2024. This program was started by Yuqin Victoria Ma (Stanford '30, src code author) and Yunshu Zhang (Berkeley '29) as a way to extend our passions for research and with the mission to make research opportunities accessible to more peers across the world. Through mentor-mentee cohorts, CSR-x allows students to dig deeper and engage with scholarly literature, working toward the goal of producing original quantitative results. For three summers (as of Sep 2026), CSR-x has served students from almost every continent in disciplines including biomedical & health sciences, environmental science, and data science/machine learning.

# vinext-starter

A clean full-stack starter running on
[vinext](https://github.com/cloudflare/vinext), with optional Cloudflare D1 and
Drizzle support.


## Prerequisites
Node.js `>=22.13.0`

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

This starter does not use `wrangler.jsonc`.

## Included Shape

- edit site code under `app/`
- `.openai/hosting.json` declares optional Sites D1 and R2 bindings
- `vite.config.ts` simulates declared bindings for local development
- `db/schema.ts` starts intentionally empty
- `examples/d1/` contains an optional D1 example surface
- `drizzle.config.ts` supports local migration generation when needed

## Workspace Auth Headers

Signed-in visitors receive both `oai-authenticated-user-id` and `oai-authenticated-user-email`. Private Sites require every visitor to sign in; public Sites may also have anonymous visitors, for whom neither header is present.

The user ID is stable for the same user on the same Site and different across Sites. Email and name are intended for display or contact purposes.

SIWC-authenticated workspace sites may also receive
`oai-authenticated-user-full-name` when the user's SIWC profile has a non-empty
`name` claim. The full-name value is percent-encoded UTF-8 and is accompanied by
`oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding: percent-encoded-utf-8`.

Treat the full name as optional and fall back to email when it is absent:

```tsx
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export default async function Home() {
  const requestHeaders = await headers();
  const userId = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-id");
  const email = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-email");
  const encodedFullName = requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name");
  const fullName =
    encodedFullName &&
    requestHeaders.get("oai-authenticated-user-full-name-encoding") ===
      "percent-encoded-utf-8"
      ? decodeURIComponent(encodedFullName)
      : null;

  const displayName = fullName ?? email;
  // ...
}
```
## Useful Commands

- `npm run dev`: start local development
- `npm run build`: verify the vinext build output
- `npm test`: build the starter and verify its rendered loading skeleton
- `npm run db:generate`: generate Drizzle migrations after schema changes
